G->BD extended by G->HF
now its GH->BD
GH->BD extended by G->HF
now its GHF->BD
GHF->BD extended by H->DEF
now its GHFD->BD
Because of H->DEF we can remove D from right side of GHFD->BD
Now it's GHFD->B
GHFD->B extended by H->DEF
now its GHFDE->B
GHFDE->B extended by H->DEF
now its GHFDEF->B
GHFDEF->B extended by F->B
now its GHFDEFB->B
Because of F->B we can remove B from right side of GHFDEFB->B
Now it's GHFDEFB->
All Attributes on the right side has been eliminated
Thus it can be derived
